Supporting data for my critique of bad data journalism:

Unfortunately none of these data sources can be linked to easily. The OECD and WEF particularly have heavy, ugly interactive tools for data selection. I couldn't get the OECD system to export CSV files so I had to use Excel then format to the CSV files I include.

I have done my best to provide instructions that would allow you to reconstruct my files.
